    <h2>Exercise 1: Basic Function Creation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a function named greetUser that takes a name as a parameter and returns a greeting message.</li>
        <li>The function should be able to return appropriate greetings for various names provided.</li>
        <li>Commit: Once completed, commit this exercise's solution to your GitHub repository with the message: "Completed Exercise 1: Basic Function Creation".</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Exercise 2: Arrow Functions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Convert a given traditional function into an arrow function.</li>
        <li>Test the newly created arrow function with various parameters to ensure it works correctly.</li>
        <li>Commit: After finishing this exercise, commit the solution with the message: "Completed Exercise 2: Arrow Functions".</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
        Exercise 3: Calculations Using Arrow Functions
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an arrow function that calculates the area of a rectangle. It should take the length and breadth as parameters.</li>
        <li>Commit: Once you've achieved this, commit the solution with the message: "Completed Exercise 3: Calculations Using Arrow Functions".</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Exercise 4: Object Creation and Manipulation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Construct an object named student with properties like name, age, and grade.</li>
        <li>Add a method to the object that prints the student's details in the format: "NAME is AGE years old and is in GRADE grade."</li>
        
    </ol>
    <h2>Exercise 5: Advanced Object Methods</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Implement an object named library with properties for books (as an array) and methods to addBook(bookName) and removeBook(bookName).</li>
        <li>Ensure that the methods work correctly to add and remove books from the books array.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
